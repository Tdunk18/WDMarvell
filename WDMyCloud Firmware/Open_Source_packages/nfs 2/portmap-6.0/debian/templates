Default: false
_Description: Should portmap be bound to the loopback address?
 Portmap by default listens to all IP addresses. However, if you are
 not providing network RPC services to remote clients (you are if you are
 setting up a NFS or NIS server) you can safely bind it to the loopback 
 IP address (127.0.0.1) 
 .
 This will allow RPC local services (like FAM) to work properly, while
 preventing remote systems from accessing your RPC services.
 .
 You can also change this configuration by editing the OPTIONS
 line in the /etc/default/portmap file. If you just don't specify
 the -i option it will bind to all interfaces.
