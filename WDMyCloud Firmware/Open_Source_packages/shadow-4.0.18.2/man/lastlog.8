.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBlastlog\fR
formats and prints the contents of the last login log
\fI/var/log/lastlog\fR
file\. The
\fIlogin\-name\fR,
\fIport\fR, and
\fIlast login time\fR
will be printed\. The default (no flags) causes lastlog entries to be printed, sorted by their order in
\fI/etc/passwd\fR\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The options which apply to the
\fBlastlog\fR
command are:
.PP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-before\fR \fIDAYS\fR

\fILOGIN\fR
only\.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
.RE
.PP
If the user has never logged in the message
\fI** Never logged in**\fR
will be displayed instead of the port and time\.
.SH "NOTE"
.PP
The
\fIlastlog\fR
file is a database which contains info on the last login of each user\. You should not rotate it\. It is a sparse file, so its size on the disk is usually much smaller than the one shown by "\fBls \-l\fR" (which can indicate a really big file if you have in
\fIpasswd\fR
users with a high UID)\. You can display its real size with "\fBls \-s\fR"\.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
\fI/var/log/lastlog\fR
.RS 4
Database times of previous user logins\.
.RE
.SH "CAVEATS"
.PP
Large gaps in UID numbers will cause the lastlog program to run longer with no output to the screen (i\.e\. if in lastlog database there is no entries for users with UID between 170 and 800 lastlog will appear to hang as it processes entries with UIDs 171\-799)\.
