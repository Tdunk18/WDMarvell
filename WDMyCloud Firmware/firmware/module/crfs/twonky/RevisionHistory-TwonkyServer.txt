Known issues
- Same named albums and sorting behavior of Twonky Server: When you have same named albums from different artists in your media collection and you chose the "Album" navigation the titles from both albums will end up together in one view. We checked how to improve this behavior but each fix we found would have caused tremendous performance problems so we decided not to offer a fix. In case you have this problem we can only suggest that you manually change the metadata of the album(s) that cause this behavior.

Twonky Server v7.2.6
----------------------

**************
***
*** Important: If you use one of the non-UPnP access APIs "JSON" or "RSS", please
***            look at the section "deprecated and removed" below and look
***            for the new configuration option 'enabledeprecatedjsonandrssfeed'!
***
**************

New features
- New rpc-call: online-servies_have_changed: with optional parameter list id=xxx. This internal function informs server that online services have changed, i.e. user has added or removed some feeds.

This function has 0 or more parameters: id=<id of container that has changed>.
- Added support for new DLNA-profiles which are defined and required for RUI ("Remote User Interface") (e.g. AVC_MP4_MP_SD)
- FriendlyInfoUpdate service is now available: INI parameter enablefriendlyinfoupdate=1 enables FriendlyInfoUpdate service. In this case, control points (eg. DeviceSpy or UPnPInspector) expose this additional service.
- New ini-option for monitoring memory functions: rpc/get_stats to get content of /proc/<PID>/status and /proc/<PID>/smaps
and rpc/drop_caches to drop file caches
- New ini-option: enabledeprecatedjsonandrssfeed (see "deprecated and removed" for information)

Improvements
- Improved WebUI behavior when the "ignored directories" were changed.
- Improved the installation behavior. If upload or aggregation is disabled for Twonky Server neither the upload nor the mirror folders get created. This is only visible at initial installation - if the upload or mirror folders are present from a former installation of Twonky Server they won't get removed.
- The upload and mirrored folders are configurable now. The new properties can be set in the ini-file and are named: 
	- uploadmusicdir
	- uploadpicturedir
	- uploadvideodir
	- mirroredmusicdir
	- mirroredpicturedir
	- mirroredvideodir   
  If upload and mirroring is disabled no respective folder will be created by Twonky Server.
- We cleaned up the navigation tree. Therefore we eradicated some categories which were duplicates. No functionality was lost with the changes but Twonky Server got faster and uses less memory now.
- Updated the scaler for MacOS
- Improvement the ituneslib default value for Linux. It has been changed to blank.
- Added a clientadaptation for DLNA's "Golden DMC" for certification purposes.
- Improved the reporting of Twonky Server. The reports include codec information.
- Improved Twonky Server’s subtitle support. The server is now able to add subtitle files after the content has already been scanned. Previously, subtitle files had to be placed there prior to the content and if the file system notification events would come in the wrong order Twonky Server could miss the subtitle file. 
  This improvement works only for systems that support file system event notifications.


Bug fixes
- 
- Fixed inconsistencies in the SystemUpdateIDs generated by Twonky Server
- Fixed a bug where the rpc-call "stop" didn't stop the server
- Fixed a bug at browsing the online videos which sometimes led to long response times

- Fixed: If DLNA pre-scaled content was set up for play speed test, then server did not provide all play speeds for which pre-scaled content was available.
- Fixed: Sometimes the default gateway was not set.
- Fixed default shares on Mac. Previously the entries for music and photo folders were incorrectly set.
- Fixed a problem with the tray app on MacOS where the server wasn’t terminated correctly so that the server couldn’t be started and stopped from the tray app properly.

Deprecated and removed
- get_timeout_period rpc-call removed
- RSS and JSON feeds are marked as deprecated - they will be no longer available in one of the following TwonkyServer versions.
  In order to still be able to use these feeds the INI-parameter has to be set:
  enabledeprecatedjsonandrssfeed=1

Known issues
- Some online services problems aren't fixed:
	- Occasionally seen problems with facebook feeds
- For Genre/Artist/Album and Playlists the server offers wrong albumart: Instead of the first valid albumart for thumbnail the default albumart is used.
- We have seen occasional hangs in the web UI when the navigation tree view was changed repeatedly.

Twonky Server v7.2.4
---------------------

New feature
- Added support for IO-Nice on Linux systems. Linux allows an application to set the priority for its IO operations on a per thread level - this feature can only be enabled on build-level.Please note: This feature is kernel specific and therefore may require adaptations for any specific platform.

Improvements
- When installing on a Windows system it's possible to choose that Twonky Server isn't launched directly after installation. Settings option can be found in "custom installation".
- Improved the standby mode of TwonkyServer:
	To enter Standby Mode invoke RPC rpc/enter_standby_mode. On entering Standby Mode TwonkyServer will send byebye messages to the network to indicate to clients it is no longer available
	To exit Standby Mode send signal SIG_USR1 to TwonkyServer for example by calling kill:
	kill –USR1 <process-id>
	On exit from Standby Mode TwonkyServer will re-announce itself to the network. The key advantage of using Standby Mode over simple stopping and restarting: Twonky becomes available almost instantly after exiting standby mode
	NOTE: Standby Mode is only available for Linux versions of TwonkyServer
- Added aiff metadata support

- mytwonky nodes are renamed to online services
    - my.twonky.com abandoned as back-end. New back-end available to configure online feeds
- TwonkyWebDAV server abandoned

New Features

- New accounting module
    - Each OEM build needs two license files (twonky.dat and twonky.license) now. These files are generated for the exact OEM version and will be provided with the binaries we deliver. Please note that the license files will be bound to each target binary AND version and must be exchanged with each new version!
- New device database behavior. The device database is persistent now. Devices that are found in the same network as the server will stay in the database even if they are turned off. After two weeks unseen by Twonky Server they will vanish from the list per default. This behavior can be changed via ini-setting:
    - pdbexpiretime=
  - The following rpc_calls are related to using the persistent device database:
    - persist_device:
      http://127.0.0.1:9000/rpc/persist_device?device=uuid:xxx&persist=1
      http://127.0.0.1:9000/rpc/persist_device?key=[GatewayMac::DeviceIndex]&persist=[BOOLEAN]
      Sets or Resets device to persist unless explicitly removed.
    - get_persistent_db_list
      http://127.0.0.1:9000/rpc/get_persistent_db_list
      Returns persistent db list in xml format.
    - reset_specific
      http://127.0.0.1:9000/rpc/reset_specific?gateway=[GatewayMAC]
      Clears persistent db for specific gateway.
      GatewayMAC is mac address of the gateway in XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX format.
- New ini-setting memsharinglimit
    - Default value 0 means no limit
    - Value is in megabytes (taking 1 megabyte to be 1000000 bytes)
    - The limit is not a hard limit. Twonky will continue to allocate memory past the limit for its normal operation e.g. streaming, device discovery etc.
    - low values will be rounded up to a sensible value (<3MB)
    - After the limit is hit, if any content is unshared (either a location is unshared or some contents are deleted) then Twonky allows sharing of new content (provided the used memory goes below the threshold)
    - RPC info_status reports if the memory limit has been hit
- New rpc-call "rpc/client_change"
    - This rpc-call substitutes "rpc_client_add", "rpc_client_enable" and "rpc/client_disable"
      http://127.0.0.1:9000/rpc/client_change?key=KEY&id=CLIENTID&enabled=BOOLEAN&view=VIEWNAME
      Updates a client in the servers client list.
      Parameter:
        KEY = GatewayMAC::DeviceIndex (GatewayMAC in format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)
        CLIENTID= client id (""Generic Media Receiver"" = -2 ,""Generic Music Only Receiver"" = -1, ""CTT DLNA 1.5"" = 2, ""Generic DLNA 1.0"" = 1)
        BOOLEAN = 0|1 enable (1) or disable (0) this client
        VIEWNAME = navigation tree view to be used with this client 
      Provide one or more of above parameters to update client identified by KEY
- Added support for beaming to Roku box (Roku 2 XS)
- Added reset possibility to playlists
- iOS: Native playlists can be imported by Twonky Server
- Added beaming support for audio from iOS to AppleTV

Improvements
- Instead of IP address and network also the use of network interface name for network related configuration is allowed
    - new ini-setting 
	- iface
      The iface option can be used to specify a single network interface or a list of network interfaces to bind to.
    
	- ignoreiface
      The ignoreiface option can be used to specify a network interface or a list of network interfaces which Twonky should not bind to.
- The following ini-settings do no longer require a restart of the server when they are changed while the server is running:
	- friendlyname
	- ip
    
	- vlevel
	- language
	- httpport
